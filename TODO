---
Skeletal animation to assimp import
---
Rename glhckTextDraw to glhckTextStash
Give glhckText a StashClear function (don't clear after render)
---
Rename glhck<Object>Set<Foo> to glhck<Object><Foo>
While getters are glhck<Object>Get<Foo>
Exceptions are methods where single property is not set
for example the children stuff in glhckObject (you add/remove childrens instead)
---
Track sub texture data uploads
---
Use 2_10_10_10_REV for color && normals
Better precision, same size
---

Reason for this file is that I keep forgetting things \o/
Feel free add more items.
